                <h5>Filipino inspired Recipe</h5>
                <h2>CREMA DE FRUTA</h2>
                <p>Crema de fruta is a popular Filipino dessert or snack which consists of layers of sponge cake, sweet custard, canned fruits and finished off with gelatin glaze on top. It is usually served during Christmas time but can be enjoyed the whole year round.</p>
                <p>I have seen other versions of this traditional cake. Some use graham crackers or lady fingers as the base instead of the sponge cake. Others use whipped cream instead of the custard and some use fresh fruits instead of the canned ones. Whichever version of crema de fruta you make, they will surely satisfy your sweet cravings.</p>
                <p>I am not fond of cakes but crema de fruta is one of those cakes that I love to indulge with. Eating a slice of this fruit cake brings back fond memories of me eating it as an after-school snack. I never thought I would be able to make this at home and enjoy it with my family. Making the cake soft and fluffy, getting the right texture and consistency for the custard were some of the challenges I faced. After plenty of painstaking hours of testing, I finally was able to create a crema de fruta that I am proud to share with you all.</p>

            <h2>HOW TO MAKE CREMA DE FRUTA:</h2>
            <p>The first step in creating this colorful dessert/snack is to make the base layer, the sponge cake. First, whisk the dry ingredients together in a medium bowl. Then, mix the egg yolks and the rest of the wet ingredients in a separate bowl. After that, add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients until combined and set aside. Next, whisk the egg whites and sugar until stiff peaks form. Fold the egg white mixture into the cake batter, a third at a time. Then, pour the cake batter into an 8-inch baking pan lined with parchment paper and bake in the preheated 350 degree oven for 30 to 35 minutes. Cool the cake, remove from the pan and cool completely on a wire rack.</p>
            <p>To prepare the sweet custard, heat the milk and then set aside. Next, whisk together the egg yolks, flour, sugar and water until smooth. Whisk the hot milk slowly into the flour mixture. Sift the mixture into a clean pan and then cook further until thick. Afterwards, add the vanilla extract. Transfer the mixture into a bowl to cool.</p>
            <p>To make the gelatin glaze, dissolve the gelatin powder in water. Add the gelatin mixture to the boiled mixture of reserved fruit cocktail juice and sugar. Set aside to cool.</p>
            <p>The final step is to assemble the layers. First transfer the cooled sponge cake into an 8-inch glass container. Spread the sweet custard over the cake and then cover the custard with the drained canned fruits and cherries. Finally, pour the gelatin mixture over the fruits. Place the cake in the fridge to chill for 6 hours or overnight.</p>

            <h2>TIPS:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The eggs should be at room temperature.</li>
                <li>Separate the egg yolks from the egg whites carefully.</li>
                <li>In making the sponge cake, do not over-mix when you are folding in the egg white mixture (meringue) into the cake batter.</li>
                <li>In making the custard, slowly add the hot milk into the egg-flour mixture while whisking constantly. This step will prevent the eggs from scrambling.</li>
